Increase the quality of your music collection by assigning a global shortcut to this script. :)

- right-click the "Application Laucher" (blue K, in the lower left corner)
- select "Menu Editor"
- click "New Item" and give it a name (like "delete current track")
    - Command: "python $HOME/.kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts/deltrack/deltrack.py" (without quotes)
    - untick "Enable launch feedback"
- open the "Advanced" tab (ALT+A)
- click the "Current shortcut key" button and assign the shortcut

Have fun!
